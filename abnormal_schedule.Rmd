# Background before we begin

  A. First of all, welcome. My intention is to keep instructions brief and simple. 

  B. You are always welcome to ask for clarification. It is helpful to your instructor if you try to ask the class first because often the class can be helpful. So, please first ask a question in Canvas. If it's personal, please use my email account brian.holt@seattlecolleges.edu

  C. It is absolutely crucial that students, teachers, all of us, respect that everybody comes to this class with different experiences, abilities, and intentions..

  D. It can be embarrassing to ask for help. Please try to ask anyway.  I'll do my best to be thoughtful in reply. 

  E. My intention as the instructor is to teach you ways to evaluate quality knowledge and to practice quality thinking and quality writing. The context of this endeavor is going to be in psychology.

  F. Computer requirements: 

   1. You must have access to a real computer for writing. If you cannot afford a laptop or do not have a laptop or computer please contact me because we actually have free rentals for students. 

   2. A tablet or smartphone will be insufficient. It's fine to do some communication (texting etc) using those tools, but for real writing you're going to need a real computer or a laptop. 
  
  3. You'll need to have quality access to the internet.  IF you don't have consistent access to the internet from home, we have loaner hotspots that you can borrow for free.  They should give you internet at home.
  
G. Software (apps)

  1. A web browser, like firefox, chrome. 

  2. A free Google doc account. If you have Gmail you already have a Google account for documents and spreadsheets. **This is a requirement; no other word processing software will be allowed.** I have reasons and we can talk about them but unless it is related to a disability accommodation you must be using Google docs.

H. Here is the pattern of the course: 

  1. Each week you will be given a list of things to read and it's list of things to do. 
  2. Most of what you'll do is some type of writing assignment in google docs. I will give you instructions and support for how to do this. 
  3. When you have finished the weeks assignment, you will post a link to your work in slack.
  4. Assignments should be submitted in a timely fashion. Friday is the standing due date, with reasonable flexibility.

# Week 1 April 1 {#Week1} 


## What do you want to focus on
Think about what you want to learn:

Some topics in the past that I have taught include the following and you may find them useful starting points to think about your own process for this quarter.

1. Critical thinking
2. Technical writing new paragraph finding published research
3. Evaluating the quality of published articles, for example contrasting popular sources from academic or scholarly.
4. General introduction to the content of psychology
5. Theories within psychology
6. Criticisms of psychology
7. Limits of psychology
8. Philosophy of science
9. Working within groups
10. Psychology as it relates to other disciplines
11. Etiology of Abnormal psychology (causes)

Any and all of these above could qualify.

The goal here is for us to collectively think of it about what you'd like to learn in our time together.

This list is not exhaustive. There's some things that you may want to focus on or add. Perhaps this might include cognitive dissonance about being a white person and being told that you've got white privilege. What are some ways one can think about opening up to that feedback?

Although I have some expert content knowledge in psychology, it's not exhaustive. I don't know everything, I have my own biases and that there may be things you'd like to learn about and practice and I would be open to hearing those things as well as how to incorporate it into the overall class. 

## Read the following

1. [The syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE){target="_blank"}

2. [Miller's law of communication (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE/edit#heading=h.exo9wouxy9qk){target="_blank"}

3. [George Orwell, Politics and the English Language, 1946 (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE/edit#heading=h.x9ksgtnaprc6){target="_blank"}

4. [The 9 standards of Critical thinking (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE/edit#bookmark=id.d16shfpyaqlj){target="_blank"}

5. [Textbook, Module 1: What is Abnormal Psychology?](https://opentext.wsu.edu/abnormal-psych/chapter/module-1-what-is-abnormal-psychology/){target="_blank"}

6. Dictionary/Wikipedia definitions on: 

      *Anthropomorphize
 
      *Ethnocentrism

```{block,type='blueBackground'}

Okay, the following items ( 7, 8, 9) deserve a little bit of explanation on my side, and patience on yours.  You may be a very practical sort of person who very much does not like philosophy.  Still, without it, we would not have science. It's True!  Do you know what  Ph.D stands for?  Check it out.

Anyway.  While watching these videos, and reading the sources, jot down some notes, including reactions, emotions and thoughts, try to track where your mind wanders (if it wanders), also notice when you get distracted, what part of the reading or video were you just watching?  And don't be afraid to keep asking 'so what?'

That's the kind of question you can put in your one-document-to-rule, or even ask questions on the [muddy point canvas room](https://canvas.seattlecolleges.edu/courses/16722/discussion_topics/155047?module_item_id=735213){target="_blank"}


Also, I hope to make these videos a lot better in terms of production.  I think I made them at the beginning of the pandemic and well, bleh.
```

7. watch intro lecture on epistemology

[![Epistemology 7min](../images/Epistemology_better.png){width="40%"}](https://youtu.be/cIq2co5CXiA "Epistemology"){target="_blank"}

[![Ontology 1 7 min](../images/Ontology_Mech_Organ.png){width="40%"}](https://youtu.be/RHBljDEU5GE "Ontology"){target="_blank"}

10. Read about "stereotype threat".  Not stereotypes.  There is a difference.  You'll need to find a source or two on your own.  


```{block,type='blueBackground'}
Some of the links below jump to the references section at the end of this document.  From there, you may find links to the actual article or you will have references to fetch from our college's library databases.  
```
<br />  

11. [Module 2: Models of Abnormal Psychology](https://opentext.wsu.edu/abnormal-psych/chapter/module-2-models-of-abnormal-psychology/){target="_blank"}

12. [Diathesis stress video youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MaaORgCHvc){target="_blank"}

```{block, type='instructorNote'}
Please have the following readings below, @efran_defining_2007, @szasz_myth_1960, and @@watters_americanization_2010  read by Tuesday of week 2 (April 9) so that we can discuss in class.
```


13. @efran_defining_2007 (to obtain this article, you'll need to walk through the steps found in the [Using the Library section down below in the appendix](#useLibrary) --in particular the [Periodical Locator](#PeriodicalLocator))

  * I want students to read the 'how to use a library' section, but I can admit that students may not want to.  The crux of finding this particular article is found in the following steps: [How to find an article](#libraryMainPoint).
    
<br>  

14. @szasz_myth_1960  which can be found using this link [Szasz link to web](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Szasz/myth.htm){target='_blank'}

15. Americanization of Mental Illness @watters_americanization_2010 which [can be found in our syllabus by clicking this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE/edit#bookmark=id.a11215pgy49s){target='_blank'}



## Do the following

1. Introduce yourself the [Slack Introductions channel](https://abnormalpsych-zgb5710.slack.com/archives/C06RYV707AS){target="_blank"}

2. Write something about what interests you about Abnormal psychology in your one google doc. Be sure to give it a title.  You can also insert a page break between your writings.  

3. On the same google document, make a new page, title it, and write some thoughts down to the following prompts.  When you are done, post to the [Week 1 slack channel](https://abnormalpsych-zgb5710.slack.com/archives/C06RR1WFE23){target="_blank"}.

    *   What is your process for thinking clearly?

    *   How do you know something is true?
    

4. Read some of your classmates' posts and comment on some. 

5. synthesize @efran_defining_2007 , @szasz_myth_1960, and @watters_americanization_2010.  When synthesizing, don't summarize the articles. You may assume that your audience is your class, which means they should be familiar with those articles.  Instead of summarizing, let you references to their work so you can do yours.  If this doesn't make sense, post a question to the #muddy-point-channel.
<br />  
    * [Lecture on one way to write a synthesis paper--This should pop-up a new tab/window but you'll have to log in to canvas because that is how the videos are stored.](https://northseattle.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=44737fc2-c8cb-4286-9dcf-ac4b011de256){target='_blank'}
<br />  

6. When you are done, create a link to your work: highlight the title of your assignment and then go to the "Insert" menu of google. In that menu, find "bookmark" and select that. Your title is now a bookmark and if you hover over it, you should see a little 'link' option.  Copy that link and post it in the canvas discussion [Week 1 slack channel](https://abnormalpsych-zgb5710.slack.com/archives/C06RR1WFE23){target="_blank"}.

7. Read a few other students and make some comments on their post.   Use google docs to make these comments.  Highlight any part of their document and you can insert a comment. you can click and use the menu, or you can use the keyboard shortcut 'ctrl + alt +m'


```{block,type='blueBackground'}
In slack, when you hover your mouse over a person's post, you should see a little floating menu.  One of the icons allows you to reply. It makes a side thread. This keeps the channel a bit more tidy and easier to read.

You can also link to each post or side thread.

You can even set a reminder to revisit a post by right clicking on the 3 vertical dots (more actions) .
```
<br />  

8. Please fill out this [Importance of Sexuality Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpnmmTRSjBNa50tTLHsUX3venfF8aTe85CCXVha6cFeO_Sew/viewform?usp=sf_link){target='_blank'}.  It is anonymous. I do not collect information that can be personally tied to you. If you are logged into your google account, google will show you your email address and say that you can use your account to 'store' your work so that you can come back to it. But that's google and not the survey.  I don't track your email.

* It's not required, but it's helpful for my classes because it is useful to see how surveys are supposed to work. 



# Week 2 April 8 {#Week3} 

```{block, type='blueBackground'}
Although we aren't using canvas, a few videos I've made are stored in Panopto.  I don't think you need to log into canvas for them to work.  But you may be prompted.

After reading/watching the above...

## Do the following

1. In the one document to rule them all, write about which psychology Model from [Module 2: Models of Abnormal Psychology](https://opentext.wsu.edu/abnormal-psych/chapter/module-2-models-of-abnormal-psychology/){target="_blank"} resonates with you and why---Yes you may have skimmed this for week 1.

2.  Ask chatGpt what makes a good diagnostic system. Start in the abstract. Ask it about "criteria". Keep on the lookout for terms like "specificity" and "sensitivity".  From here, find some questions in it's responses and ask it to elaborate, to challenge it. Share your questions in your one google doc.

3. In your google doc, write a short essay about what you learned from chatGpt and any other source regarding diagnostic decision making. 

4. Lastly, in the one document to rule them all, list some questions about the readings/content for this week. Things you would like to learn more about. 

5. Post to [#week2--notice this is a clickable link](https://abnormalpsych-zgb5710.slack.com/archives/C06STTMFE0P){target="_blank"}



# Appendix

## Using the library {#useLibrary} 

The library has set up a simple library guide for our class.  You can find it here: [Abnormal Psychology library guide](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/psych220). I

```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note: Don't pay for articles</span>

One important word of advice is to never pay for a scholarly article. If you go online and use Google, or even Google Scholar to find online sources, you may be directed to the publication that will charge you a large amount of money to access just one article.  So don’t do that.

Generally there are ways to get articles through our library, so don't pay for articles.
```


To get started with our readings, you'll need to use our Library (online, of course) to obtain many of the articles.  

Finding journal articles is a skill that gets better with practice.  This happens to be why Librarians are so helpful.  They've actually been trained so if you can't find an article, it's okay to ask librarians for help.  

In fact, here is how you can [get help from North Seattle's library staff](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/askus). 



### Relationship of an article to its Journal

Using hierarchies helps us organize information. Journal articles, or for that matter the file directories on your computer, work somewhat like an address for a person's home. There are several different parts that give us information to track down and locate whatever it is we're looking for, be it a computer file, or Journal article. Basically, a journal article  has the following components, some of which may be familiar to you :

      Database (of periodicals)
        Periodical (eg., magazine, newspaper, scholarly journal)
         Year (of publication)
           Volume Number
            Volumne Issue number
             Page Number (optional, often unnecessary)
               Article Title
                  Author

So, to find an article, you'll need to know the parts above.  When you are given a list of references, or citations, nearly all of the information needed above is given to  you.  What is not given, or at least is done implicitly with web searches, is access to the top part, the database.  

#### Here is a typical citation:

>Author(s). (year of pub). "Article Title." <span class='underline'>Periodical title</span>. Volume Number (issue number).

The information in a citation isn't presented in the same hierarchy as above, but all of the necessary parts are there.  

Here is an example citation (reference) for something we may read.  Can you identify the periodical?

>Jay Efran, Michael Lukens, Mitchell Greene. 2007. “Defining Psychotherapy: The Last 25 Years Have Taught Us That It’s Neither Art nor Science.” <span class='underline'>Psychotherapy Networker</span> 31 (2). 

Most of the items in the list above are self-explanatory. I want to focus a bit about periodicals.

```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note on formatting citations: underlining publication titles</span>

In print, publication titles are *italicized*.  I have a very hard time noticing that subtle font.  

When you submit a written manuscript for printing, publication titles are <span style='text-decoration: underline'>underlined</span> because traditionally manuscripts were typed with typewriters, and to be able to type italicized words required an entire additional alphabet represented in the hammers.  So, underlining was how you could emphasize a word, and the printer--a physical person--could notice the author's formatting intent and correctly publish the final product in italics. 

It's a bit different now with our computers, obviously.  Still, I have a hard time seeing italicized words and will occasionally use underline. 

So, sometimes I'll underline pub titles, sometimes I'll italicize. I have no rule on this.  I am chaos manifested.  Beware. 
```

#### Periodicals

These are just the names of the major publication. _The New York Times_, is colloquially known as a newspaper but technically it is a periodical. <span class='underline'>The Journal of Abnormal Psychology</span> is also a periodical. 

When we search for articles, we have to first know which journal, or periodical, owns that article.  So it is a little counter intuitive but once we have identified an article we would like to read, we have to first find out whether or not our College has access to that periodical.  

To do that, we have to use our colleges periodical locator.

### Finding a journal using Periodical locator

#### Periodical locator {#PeriodicalLocator} 

Notice the first link within [North's Article page](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/articles){target="_blank"}.  It should say "Periodical Locator"

There are many databases, inside of these databases are pages of journals, and inside those journals are articles. 

**We need to use the periodical locator to determine which database houses which periodical.  With that, we can then open up that periodical and get the article**


```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note on 'free' articles and tuition/fees</span>

Part of the fees that you pay as a student are used to pay subscriptions for these periodical databases. We have a small, but pretty good selection. Major universities have much larger collections due to their size and tuition/fee structure.

So in a way, you are **not** actually getting this for free because you are paying for library access. That's the benefit of taking classes from a college. If you were not an active student, you would not be able to see many of these articles.

So, download them all!
```

##### Here's the main point: {#libraryMainPoint} 

I've given you a list of Articles to read. To read them, you must first find them; some will be out in the internet, some will be in our schools' databases. So, use the information I've given you to find out which location (database, Wikipedia, Google, Google scholar) you'll need to search to obtain the full article. You will start by using the periodicals locator tool.

Let's use that @efran_defining_2007 article.  

1. Go to  [North's Article page](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/articles) and click on the periodical locator.  

2. Type in the name of the periodical for Efran's piece. 

You will see a link with the periodical's name.  Go ahead and click on this but beware of the next instruction:

3. Once you have clicked on that link you may want to start searching within that publication. But do not do that. Instead, notice a little bit further down the search box you should see something that says "View online" and beneath that you should see something that says "proquest research library".   It’s this piece we need.

    That Proquest research library is the database that you've all paid fees to access. So you need to remember that database name.  Or, I think now you can just click on it and skip to step 8.

4. While remembering that database name, you need to go back to  [North's Article page](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/articles).

5. Notice what is presented here.  You can see Periodical locator, but notice "A to Z" list of databases.  (You might also notice just below two links; one to academic search and the other to Proquest).



6. Click on "A to Z"

7. You might notice that there are 67 databases that North Seattle has premium access to. In our case we're going to be looking for the proquest direct database. And we can either click on the letter "P" or we can just type in proquest direct.


```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note on Popular sources</span>

You may also notice the little tag "popular" next to proquest link.  That's an indicator that the articles are not peer reviewed and so aren't exactly cutting edge science. Even though this particular journal we are looking for, _Psychotherapy Networker_, is flagged as a popular type, it is a place for therapists to share their thoughts on the profession so there is a lot of value in it.

For help in distinguishing the different types of sources, the library has some guides:

* [Scholar vs popular](http://libguides.northseattle.edu/c.php?g=97441&p=630690)

* [Find Scholarly Journals](http://libguides.northseattle.edu/c.php?g=97441&p=630669)

```

8. Opening Proquest from your home, or remotely, you will need to validate your credentials. In other words, you need to prove that your are in fact a student of North Seattle before you can continue, which is why you've been prompted for your @ seattlecolleges.edu email and password. Once you do that you'll then be able to see inside of the proquest database. Then you can now search for the article.

     - 8a. If you don't know your @ seattlecolleges.edu email, or email password, you can go to this location [https://tools.seattlecolleges.edu/Initialize/resetmypassword](https://tools.seattlecolleges.edu/Initialize/resetmypassword){target='_blank'} to update it, reset/change the password. If you still can't get access, let me know.
<p>     </p>
9. You should see a simple search box, where you can enter important bits of information. I often start with the author's last name, in this case, Efran,and then some unique identifying feature of the article. A few key words of the article title, or perhaps the full article title will be useful.

But notice that next to the text boxes there are drop down menus. You need to use those, otherwise the search engine will just search for your terms anywhere in the document and will provide too many 'hits'. Instead, you should indicate ‘Efran’ as author, and "defining" in the document title. (of course, you could search any way you like).

When you search for those two terms in their respective fields, you will get two hits and one of them is the article we need. You should notice that it is a full text, not all databases provide full text documents. But in this case it's a full text. You can either print it or read it online.

Yay.  Now you can find the other articles.
