# Week 1 Sept 25 {#Week1} 


## What do you want to focus on
Think about what you want to learn:

Some topics in the past that I have taught include the following and you may find them useful starting points to think about your own process for this quarter.

1. Critical thinking
2. Technical writing new paragraph finding published research
3. Evaluating the quality of published articles, for example contrasting popular sources from academic or scholarly.
4. General introduction to the content of psychology
5. Theories within psychology
6. Criticisms of psychology
7. Limits of psychology
8. Philosophy of science
9. Working within groups
10. Psychology as it relates to other disciplines
11. Etiology of Abnormal psychology (causes)

Any and all of these above could qualify.

The goal here is for us to collectively think of it about what you'd like to learn in our time together.

This list is not exhaustive. There's some things that you may want to focus on or add. Perhaps this might include cognitive dissonance about being a white person and being told that you've got white privilege. What are some ways one can think about opening up to that feedback?

Although I have some expert content knowledge in psychology, it's not exhaustive. I don't know everything, I have my own biases and that there may be things you'd like to learn about and practice and I would be open to hearing those things as well as how to incorporate it into the overall class. 

## Read the following

1. [The syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE){target="_blank"}

2. [Miller's law of communication (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE/edit#heading=h.exo9wouxy9qk){target="_blank"}

3. [George Orwell, Politics and the English Language, 1946 (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE/edit#heading=h.x9ksgtnaprc6){target="_blank"}

4. [The 9 standards of Critical thinking (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE/edit#bookmark=id.d16shfpyaqlj){target="_blank"}

5. [Textbook, Module 1: What is Abnormal Psychology?](https://opentext.wsu.edu/abnormal-psych/chapter/module-1-what-is-abnormal-psychology/){target="_blank"}

6. Dictionary/Wikipedia definitions on: 

      *Anthropomorphize
 
      *Ethnocentrism

```{block,type='blueBackground'}

Okay, the following items ( 7, 8, 9) deserve a little bit of explanation on my side, and patience on yours.  You may be a very practical sort of person who very much does not like philosophy.  Still, without it, we would not have science. It's True!  Do you know what  Ph.D stands for?  Check it out.

Anyway.  While watching these videos, and reading the sources, just down some notes, including reactions, emotions and thoughts, try to track where your mind wanders (if it wanders), also notice when you get distracted, what part of the reading or video were you just watching?  And don't be afraid to keep asking 'so what?'

That's the kind of question you can put in your one-document-to-rule, or even ask questions on the [muddy point canvas room](https://abnormalpsych-umw3641.slack.com/archives/C043N750A69){target="_blank"}


Also, I hope to make these videos a lot better in terms of production.  I think I made them at the beginning of the pandemic and well, bleh.

7. watch intro lecture on epistemology

[![Epistemology 7min](../images/Epistemology_better.png){width="40%"}](https://youtu.be/cIq2co5CXiA "Epistemology"){target="_blank"}

8. **Skim from page 2**, sub heading "The Theory of Knowledge"** of the article: An introduction to Stephen C. Pepper's philosophical system via
_World Hypotheses: A Study in Evidence_**, @berry_introduction_1984 [(found in syllabus) ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9QMbTfv5QUjsvHpcy3sJtx6nCve67J4zPbgVE9zhHE/edit#bookmark=id.kapuzuy6k04e){target="_blank"}

9. Watch vid on Ontology, essentially a review of the World hypotheses reading above:

[![Ontology 1 7 min](../images/Ontology_Mech_Organ.png){width="40%"}](https://youtu.be/RHBljDEU5GE "Ontology"){target="_blank"}

10. Read about "stereotype threat".  Not stereotypes.  There is a difference.  You'll need to find a source or two on your own.  


## Do the following

1. Introduce yourself the [canvas Introductions forum](https://canvas.seattlecolleges.edu/courses/16722/discussion_topics/153141){target="_blank"}

2. Write something about what interests you about Abnormal psychology in your one google doc. Be sure to give it a title.  You can also insert a page break between your writings.  

3. On the same google document, make a new page, title it, and write some thoughts down to the following prompts.  When you are done, post to the Week 1 Canvas forum.

  *    what is your process for thinking clearly?

  *   How do you know something is true?
    

4. Read some of your classmates' posts and comment on some. 

The idea is to be doing weekly writing about the things we read and the prompts that I give you and then you're going to share that information in slack.
