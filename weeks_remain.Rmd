# Week 5 May 1 {#Week5} 

## MetaCognition

To begin, and before you start doing more reading and writing, I want you to first imagine some scenario. Maybe it’s simple like watching a bird. Maybe you can do it right now as you read these instructions.  If you want to write it in your google document, you can.  But you don't have to. 



While you do this, imagine that you are able to witness your thoughts from the point of view of another person, or perhaps a different side of yourself.

>“So, I can see myself, Brian, sitting at his computer writing these words and I notice that Brian looks up at the window and appreciates the leaves in the sun on the Rhododendron outside this room; it was around then that Brian thought to use ‘watching a bird’ as a part of the assignment. He also felt a little like he’d rather be out in the sun but a lot of people need him to finish this. Brian also considered not including that last sentence.”

It might be that you are watching your behavior and then noting the pattern of how/where your thoughts come about; it might be an auditory exercise where you’re able to listen and hear the words you’re saying. Most of you do this naturally, but some of you might not have a lot of experience in observing your own thoughts. This is a meta cognitive exercise.

## Do, Watch, and Read the following

A. Read [Module 5: stress Disorders](https://opentext.wsu.edu/abnormal-psych/chapter/module-5-trauma-and-stressor-related-disorders/){target="_blank"}

B. Read Nancy Chick, [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/){target="_blank"}

C. Read Alfie Kohn, [The Case Against Grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/){target="_blank"}

D. Read Booth et al. Craft Of Research excerpt, just below in blue @boothCraftResearch2016.  Notice the metacognitive aspects


```{block,type='blueBackground'}
<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Craft of Research Excerpt</h2>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Why write our research up?</h4>

For some of you, the invitation to join into a expert research conversation may still seem easy to decline but if you accept it you'll 

One answer is that we write not just to share our work but to improve it before we do.

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Why write our research up?</h4>

For some of you, the invitation to join into a expert research conversation may still seem easy to decline but if you accept it you'll have to find a good question, search for sound data, formulate and support a good answer and then write it all up and even if you turn out a first-rate paper, it may be read not by anyone in the world but only by your teacher. And besides, you may think, my teacher knows all about my topic. What do I gain from writing up my research, other than proving I can do it?

One answer is that we write not just to share our work but to improve it before we do.

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Write to remember</h4>

Experienced researchers first write just to remember what they read. A few talented people can hold in mind masses of information, but most of us get lost when we think about what *Smith found in light of Wong's position, and compare both to the odd data in Brunelli, especially as they are supported by Buscovich but what was it that Smith said?* When you don't take notes on what you read, you are likely to forget or, worse misremember it.

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Write to understand</h4>

The second reason for writing is to see larger patterns in what you read. When you arrange and rearrange the results of your research in new ways, you discover new implications, connections, and complications. Even if you could hold it all in mind, you would need help to line up arguments that pull in different directions, plot out complicated relationships, sort out disagreements among experts. 

*I want to use these claims from long, but her argument is undercut by Smith's data. When I put them side-by-side, I see that Smith ignores this last part of Wong's argument. aha! If I introduce it with this part from Brunelli, I can focus on one more clearly. *

That's why careful researchers never put off writing until they've gathered all the data they need: they write from the start of their projects to help them assemble their information in new ways. 

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Write to test your thinking</h4>

But even when they agree that writing is an important part of learning thinking and understanding some still wonder why they can't write up their research in their own way, why they have to satisfy demands imposed by a community that they have not joined, or even want to, and conform to conventions they did nothing to create. 

*Why should I adopt language in forms that are not mine? Aren't you just trying to turn me into an academic light yourself? If I write as you expect me to, I risk losing my identity.*

Such concerns are legitimate (most teachers wish students would raise them more often). But it would be a feeble education that did not change you at all, and the deeper your education the more it will change the "you" that you are or want to be.

That's why it is so important to choose carefully what you study and with whom. But it would be a mistake to think that learning to report sound research must threaten your true identity. It will change the way you think, but only by giving you more ways of thinking. You will be different by being freer to choose who you want to be and what you want to do with your life. 

But the most important reason for learning to write in ways readers expect is that when you write for others, **you demand more of yourself and when you write for yourself alone.** By the time you fix your ideas in writing, they are so familiar to you that you need help to see them not for what you want them to be *but for what they really are.* 

You will understand your own work better when you try to anticipate your readers inevitable and critical questions: how have you evaluated your evidence? Why do you think it's relevant? What ideas have you considered but rejected?
```





## Do the following

1. Search for 3 reasonably competent definitions of trauma, but avoid the DSM.  You can use the DSM as a 4th source for contrast, if you want. Include references and do a quick summary/description of what you found. 
2. In the same document, how would you defend your answer to the statement:

>Everyone goes through trauma.

3. Post your paper in the [#week5 channel](https://spr23abnormalpsych.slack.com/archives/C055GT2TR7C){target="_blank"}

4. Do A [self-reflection Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCKXCNvH-nSdnuCz0OrFUcQPZXVEugR4D5lyBiZzNKYVkANw/viewform){target="_blank"}

    * The text boxes you see in this survey will expand to accommodate what you need to write. In other words, don’t feel like you must only say like 3 words to just fit the box shown.


# Week 6 May 8 {#Week6} 

```{block, type='instructorNote'}
On Thursday, May 11, there will be no classes held for the whole school.  

Faculty are expected to be doing other college work.  

Which means none of you can be required to attend any class on 5/11.  For any class.  In the whole Seattle college district.  
```


## Read the following

a. Read/skim [Primer for Behaviorism and Semantic networks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MMziOQh7NjWRnrzCZDT99ArOu8Nv6CzQfTEfbSCzjYA/){target="_blank"}

* skim this but pay closer attention the semantic sections with the schematics for cars
* Think of a subject.  Maybe it's something academic like math, biology.  Maybe it's about sports, or in particular a single sport, like (the only one that matters) basketball.  
   * in what specific ways would the semantic network be different between a novice and expert?  I don't expect you to know technical terms here (like nodes, edges) but I want you to have an appreciation for how people may differ in terms of their networks

D. [Module 9: Obsessive and Hoarding disorders](https://opentext.wsu.edu/abnormal-psych/chapter/module-9-obsessive-compulsive-and-related-disorders/){target="_blank"}

## Do the following

 1. Pick one of the disorders in the OCD module: 
  
  * and find 2 articles that discusses its cognitive pattern
    * The article should be from either these two school databases:
      * [Academic Search Complete](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/az.php?a=a){target="_blank"}
      * [PsychArticles](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/az.php?a=p){target="_blank"}

 2. Write a page about what you have learned.  Write a summary, but write as if you were writing it to a non-technical person that doesn't understand cognitive psychology.  

 3. post a link in the [#week6 channel](https://spr23abnormalpsych.slack.com/archives/C056L4S2ETW){target='_blank'}

 4. Pick 2 other students and invite them to read your post. In the invitation, think about what you might like to receive some feedback about. 
    * Invite people to help you on any of the critical thinking standards, for example. 
    * if you are invited to give feedback, you don't have to.  Sometimes you might have several people asking for feedback.  Don't feel like you must respond to all of them.  
    Should you chose to give feedback, be kind and try to adhere to the request. 
    * Remember that they are trying things out and are sharing potentially vulnerable parts of their lives.  If you need help giving feedback, send your instructor a /dm and I can help.
    * Also, because it’s still the pandemic and everything is just hard, don’t fret if people you invite can’t respond. It’s likely that they are just overwhelmed with something.
<p>

5. Another Sexual information questionnaire:  [Sexual Assertiveness](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCHJDqjWxvaJZRBZYdZL_TjbDyZG_4XGwgNebWbzaPwIY2Pg/viewform){target='_blank'}

    -Like before, it's optional an anonymous.  But because I found errors in my Human Sexuality textbook, I'd like to provide better information to my students while learning a bit about our community college population



# Week 7 May 15 {#Week7} 

Stats and Depression and Bipolar

I understand that stats can be boring, and I certainly don't promise to make it interesting.

I do want students to know this stuff, though you may not want to watch my 2 20 minute videos.  At least watch the last segment on effect sizes and meta analyses

Technically, what is being presented on the slide are non-standardized scores. So though what I'm saying is correct, I should have further said, "once these scores are standardized, a change in 1 unit of X will increase Y by .63".
  * [linear regression output and coefficients](https://youtu.be/8MJvoliGils?t=259){target="_blank"} 5 min #Again, at 5:15, I make a mistake in the video.  The output is in un-standardized units and so the correct statement would be " this output is for unstandardized units, a movement up 1 unit on the x axis corresponds to an increase in the y axis about .13 units; had these variables been standardized, you would see the same value as the correlation, .63"

### Brian's workflow video

#### Two Videos you could watch if you are still unclear about workflow

These do not make good TV.  It's not fun watching other people use their workflow.  If you could watch this at quad speed, I would.  But I think the best you could hope for is double speed. 

  1. This one is recent, shorter, and from an Intro to Psychology class: [Fears about snakes biological or learned:](https://youtu.be/I4PiC3xvmXk){target="_blank"} channel post

  2. In a previous course, I was asked to show how I might use tools to solve a question.  Here is a 36 minute video to that end. You might find it useful to see what I mean by "having a workflow" as a way to think critically.  But it's tedious.  Workflow isn't really exciting, so watch at 2x speeds and skip a lot. 

[Brian's workflow on whether Acute stress disorder is a good predictor of developing PTSD](https://youtu.be/y0V92Ggp0sc){target="_blank"}


## Do the following

* Search for a meta-analysis on a mood disorder (major, minor, persistent, bipolar (1,2) cyclothymia, dysthymia, or even the sub types of depression (e.g., Seasonal, postpartum)) and try to summarize the findings using your own words.  If you want to copy paste some of the language from the article, that is fine, but you should still try to use your own words to say it. 
  * here is [a video on how to find a meta-analysis in our library](https://youtu.be/8nmCpM2yi34){target="_blank"}

  * don't get lost in the details. I'm thinking this should not be more than 1 page, double spaced.  Aim for about 1/2 page of double spaced text. 
  
* Write down 5 questions about the methods of the paper.  How did they do the meta analysis?
 
* Put both writings (summary and questions) into your one document

    
5. Post a re-write of one [or two] of your past written assignments.  Please choose assignments from work completed; if you didn't finish the synthesis paper, for example, don't use it here.   
    * Don't edit your original work.  Make a new entry in your One-google-doc to rule
    * In the rewrite, you may want to use the critical thinking standards as a lens on your past work.  For instance, are there places you could be more deep in terms of complexity?  What research could inform how you think about your work from the textbook?  This is just a suggestion.

  * post your work to [#week7](https://spr23abnormalpsych.slack.com/archives/C056HG5PUPM){target='_blank'}

# Week 11 June 12; BIPOC and other underrepresented groups, psychopathology, and final paper  {#Week11}

Psychology has a problematic history of being weird.  That is:  W. E. I. R. D.
Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic.  We should also add Cis.  Doesn't fit easily in the 'Weird' acronym. 

I would also say tends to be white and it is worth being thoughtful about looking at mental disorders through the lens of people who do not fall under the weird acronym.

So one thing we can do is take some time to look at how Mental Health is different non White, non weird, non cis. 

## Read/research some stuff

This is somewhat open ended. I have a lot of ignorance about this. And so rather than me dictating to you about how you should go about researching issues of bipoc, ethnicity, diversity and equity in abnormal psychology, I want you to think about this as an opportunity to teach me, your instructor, about some things.

Still, to help get started, here are some concepts you may want to search for, and you may want to combine them in a Google Scholar search, or maybe even just a general Google search.


* Any key word that is related to ethnicity or diversity could be searched for alongside of the psychological term dealing with 'mental health', like 'abnormal psychology', Psychopathology, etc.

* Some terms that are considered offensive today were often used to describe people just 10, 20, 30 years ago.  So, if you do any historical perspectives, you might have to search using terms that feel unnatural. 

* You might consider looking at statistics of mental Health for people in certain demographics, you might want to do the same thing or all of the above for particular disorders.


###  A rubric to help evaluate critical thinking

* [As a way to support students in evaluating their own work, consider this document, a rubric!, that talks about quality of thinking/writing without the points.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DRobbPDaLLLg-kSpeh95spS8tBoPvlK7lBFqvfrzHEk/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"} 


## Do some stuff

1) Outline your process that takes advantage of your workflow.

  * Write down your wants and intentions
    * eg., "I don't understand how indigenous Americans struggle with alcohol."  "What are the suicide rates for black people in the U.S.?"
  * What information do you need to move?
    * Wikipedia?
    * stats/frequencies?
  * What information is still missing?
    * it can be sufficient to just list these things.  Not all questions have been answered.  Not all questions have even been asked.  So don't feel like if you can't find some answer that you are doing something wrong.  

2) Summarize your readings/findings

3) Identify 2 or 3 actions/concepts that seem significant for others to know

4)

  * [As a way to support students in evaluating their own work, consider this document, a rubric!, that talks about quality of thinking/writing without the points.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DRobbPDaLLLg-kSpeh95spS8tBoPvlK7lBFqvfrzHEk/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

5. [Final Self-reflection](https://forms.gle/VhfLKCBMugfDJuy18){target="_blank"}

6. All work should be completed by end of day, June 15, 2023

7. Post your work to the [#week11](https://spr23abnormalpsych.slack.com/archives/C058TATKMEG){target="_blank"}

Don't be too stressed about this assignment name. It still follows the same format of read/do stuff but I have a few more instructions that take up space.  I thought I'd try a link out to it rather than embed it. 





<!-- * Spitting in client’s soup, an article about language, concepts, personal constructs.
