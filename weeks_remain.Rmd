<!-- * Spitting in clientâ€™s soup, an article about language, concepts, personal constructs.  Please note this will hit several of the same themes in the Efran article from 2007  @efran_spitting_2015  (When you click on the year, you'll see our reference section.  And in the reference section, I give a link the article found in our school database...it may or may not work.  Post to logistics for help.) -->


<!-- 2. In your document, write about how others (people, institutions) "spit in your soup"? Make some mention as to "What is the soup?"  Post a link to your work in the #soup channel -->
