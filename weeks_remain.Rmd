# Getting started {#getStart} 

## Course Layout

Read/watch some things, write some things.  You will save these written bits of work saved in a Google doc.  Microsoft documents are too complicated (I can explain if you are interested),

### ungrading and self reflections

Could rubrics and point chasing be harmful.  Or at worst they don't foster good thinking and education.  I am realizing that using them reduce anxiety in me, the instructor, because I don't have to actually consider the student.  

An overview video on self reflection.  This is not a detailed set of instructions but a gentle intro. [self refleciton overveiw](https://youtu.be/rsH09jsGVSk){target='_blank'}


### Grades 

Grades will be based on your own assessment of what you've earned. You are giving yourself a grade. I have the right to overrule your assessment, but I anticipate people are going to be fair to themselves to this class. Feedback will be given to many of your weekly writings. However I do not promise to give feedback to all papers every week.

I intend to provide my own writing each week and my own reflection for you to witness. If I do give you feedback on a weekly writing, my intention for it is to push gently for you to consider deeper issues that is aligned with your wants for the class. If I give you feedback on a weekly assignment, the feedback will be embedded in your document. This is why I have asked you to allow anyone with the link to edit.  My hope is to just put comments right into your doc.

At least twice this quarter I will ask you to provide me a short sample of your writing from the previous weeks and a self-reflection on your progress. I will read all of these and give feedback on all of them.

The reason you're writing every week is to provide yourself a track record of writings from which you can reflect upon. If you do not do this, you won't have enough papers to reflect upon.

###  Communication

#### Canvas will be used lightly.

First week discussions and introductions, a place to find this schedule, and a way for me to quickly send announcements.

#### Please don't use Canvas as email

#### Use discussion boards in slack

First of all, you may have some questions about Slack.

It's basically a social media platform where you can participate in teams by having threaded chats or sharing of documents.It can be used synchronous synchronously or asynchronously.

The main reason I'm using it is simply that canvas does not have the same capabilities. It also requires a lot more work for me as the teacher to manage. Slack appears to be a little bit easier in that respect. 

Secondly, you may want to know how to sign up for our slack Channel.  [You will need to use this invitation:](https://join.slack.com/t/generalpsychology-hq/shared_invite/zt-hw53cjb8-Gu_GEolsoQNq2U7Q2CTvGg) (Links to an external site.)

A very important part about signing up for slack is that you need to use the email that you used to sign up for classes at North Seattle. The reason is that this will be a relatively easy way for me to make sure that the students enrolled in the class are able to access our slack Channel, and that random people cannot.

Once you have signed up for slack, spend some time filling out your profile make sure to make your profile picture and actual picture of you. And I believe every time from then on should you sign into slack, you'll see our abnormal psychology Channel.
 
The last thing about slack is that when it comes to sharing documents, you may need to add permissions for slack to interact with your word processing program. For instance I use Google Docs a lot and I have already added Google Docs as an app that is recognized by Slack.  Let me know which word processing program you use oh, it has to be a cloud-based, and I think I can add that to slack.  So far I've added Google Docs and Microsoft onedrive (both, I believe are free to use by North Seattle students.)

#### Tips for using Slack

[Slack tips, will need to sign in to canvas for this video](https://northseattle.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=ba5dc535-de92-40c7-9460-ac5301350a62){target='_blank'}

#### Adding yourself to a hidden slack channel

In Fall 2020, slack had a bug preventing the instructor from adding everyone to a channel with a single click.  This mean each person had to be added individually, which is very time consuming.  [This is a simple list of instructdions with pictures showing how to search then add yourself to a channel.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nH12L-FIFA2aXSMViuSt73WbAR9Fr78bQD0lpYTQLmg/edit?usp=sharing"){target='_blank'} 

## Access to OneDrive and email for students

I'm a fan of gmail and google drive, but as a fee-paying student in the Seattle Colleges District, you have been giving a free account with Microsoft oneDrive.  oneDrive is an online office suite that has web-based versions for email, word processing, spreadsheets, PowerPoints.  [here is where to go to set that up](https://itservices.seattlecolleges.edu/myseattlecolleges-login){target=’_blank’}

When you write a paper, you can write it directly into the word application in OneDrive, or you could write your paper on your home computer, and then as necessary upload into oneDrive.  

### Videos:  How to Log into and using oneDrive, Gmail

#### [Video how to log in to OneDrive--stored in canvas](https://northseattle.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f92016e6-6dc6-4daa-a90c-ac4d013607a6){target='_blank'}

#### [Video how to generate a sharable link in OneDrive--stored in canvas](https://northseattle.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f35b3b7d-331a-46e5-b308-ac4d013607e8){target='_blank'}

```{block, type='blueBackground'}
Please note that if you change the sharing settings, I think Microsoft creates a new URL that must be posted in our learning environment (slack, canvas, etc).  Again.  So, after you have set your sharing settings, copy the link and share it.   
```

#### [How to share a google drive doc -- stored in canvas](https://northseattle.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0f8a111c-0346-4935-b556-ac4d013fed06){target='_blank'}

##### If Uploading a .doc(x) to google 

```{block,type='blueBackground'}
If you upload a word document into google docs, google will not convert it to a google doc format; instead it will maintain it as a .doc(x) file type because some users are just using google drive as a repository to share word docx.

But I can't leave feedback on those formats.

* So, after uploading the docx file, 

* right click the file and choose to 'open as a google doc'.

* Then, share that file with edit capabilities. 
```

## Do

* Recall the 4 D's.  Write a response to the following:  In diagnosing a personality disorder what are some obstacles and or features to consider to differentiate them from healthy personalities? 

* If you want, I'd love to read articles that have a follow up analysis more than 6 months on DBT effectiveness.  (So, study therapy concludes with participants, maybe they do a 2 month follow up.  I'm looking for something more than 6 months.  Longer is better.)

# Week 11 BIPOC, psychopathology, and final paper Dec 5 {#Week11}

Psychology has a problematic history of being weird.  That is:  W. E. I. R. D.
Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic

I would also say tends to be white and it is worth being thoughtful about looking at mental disorders through the lens of people who do not fall under the weird acronym.

So one thing we can do is take some time to look at how Mental Health is different for Bipoc people

## Read/research some stuff

This is somewhat open ended. I have a lot of ignorance about this. And so rather than me dictating to you about how you should go about researching issues by bipoc, ethnicity, diversity and equity in abnormal psychology, I want you to think about this as an opportunity to teach me, your instructor, about some things.

Still, to help get started, here are some concepts you may want to search for; and you may want to combine them in a Google Scholar search, or maybe even just a general Google search.

* Any key word that is related to ethnicity or diversity could be searched for alongside of the psychological term dealing with 'mental health', like 'abnormal psychology', Psychopathology, etc.

* You might consider looking at statistics of mental Health for people in certain demographics, you might want to do the same thing or all of the above for particular disorders.

* [As a way to support students in evaluating their own work, consider this document, a rubric!, that talks about quality of thinking/writing without the points.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DRobbPDaLLLg-kSpeh95spS8tBoPvlK7lBFqvfrzHEk/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"} 


## Do some stuff

1) Outline your process that takes advantage of your workflow.

  * Write down your wants and intentions
    * eg., "I don't understand how indigenous Americans struggle with alcohol."  "What are the suicide rates for black people in the U.S.?"
  * What information do you need to move?
    * Wikipedia?
    * stats/frequencies?
  * What information is still missing?
    * it can be sufficient to just list these things.  Not all questions have been answered.  Not all questions have even been asked.  So don't feel like if you can't find some answer that you are doing something wrong.  

2) Summarize your readings/findings

3) Identify 2 or 3 actions/concepts that seem significant for others to know

4) Post your work to the [#Diversity channel](https://northseattlea-yus1991.slack.com/archives/C03FYPYSGG7){target="_blank"}


# "Week 12" cleaning up Dec 12 {#Week12}

## Do some stuff

1. [Final project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11GxIlOTqrcXQ-MlW9eikqR-dH_ErgsjCv8xu0Zj5S60/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

  * [As a way to support students in evaluating their own work, consider this document, a rubric!, that talks about quality of thinking/writing without the points.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DRobbPDaLLLg-kSpeh95spS8tBoPvlK7lBFqvfrzHEk/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

2. [Final Self-reflection](https://forms.gle/VhfLKCBMugfDJuy18){target="_blank"}

3. [All work should be completed by end of day, December 12, 2021](https://northseattle.edu/calendars/academic-calendar?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D559538082){target="_blank"}

4. Post your final to the [#Final channel](https://northseattlea-yus1991.slack.com/archives/C03GFMRCMHS){target="_blank"}

```{block, type='blueBackground'}

When searching for articles, be sure to track/take note of your search terms and combinations.  

This is important to save time.  It is not uncommon to accidentally lose articles and so you must go back and re-search.  Having no record of search terms may mean you have to recreate that history and it's time consuming.  
```
Be finished by December 12 17, 5pm (technically the last business day of the the last day of the quarter)

Don't be too stressed about this assignment name. It still follows the same format of read/do stuff but I have a few more instructions that take up space.  I thought I'd try a link out to it rather than embed it.
