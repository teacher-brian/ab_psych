	abstract = {In our response to Raskin, we caution that combining incompatible vocabularies usually results in a linguistic muddle from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape. Although omnibus terms such as “psychosocial” and “biopsychosocial” sound reasonable, they function merely as slogans, without any clear meaning or explanatory power. We recommend tailoring a linguistically consistent system to meet our needs as psychologists. We also warn against the tendency for some to blur the distinction between client input and professional perspectives.},

[...]he argued that any ceremony believed in by both parties might do the trick.},

	doi = {10.1037/h0046535},
	abstract = {My aim in this essay is to raise the question "Is there such a thing as mental illness?" and to argue that there is not. Since the notion of mental illness is extremely widely used nowadays, inquiry into the ways in which this term is employed would seem to be especially indicated.  Mental illness, of course, is not literally a "thing" -- or physical object -- and hence it can "exist" only in the same sort of way in which other theoretical concepts exist. Yet, familiar theories are in the habit of posing, sooner or later -- at least to those who come to believe in them -- as "objective truths" (or "facts").  During certain historical periods, explanatory conceptions such as deities, witches, and microorganisms appeared not only as theories but as self-evident causes of a vast number of events.  I submit that today mental illness is widely regarded in a somewhat similar fashion, that is, as the cause of innumerable diverse happenings.  As an antidote to the complacent use of the notion of mental illness -- whether as a self-evident phenomenon, theory, or cause--let us ask this question: What is meant when it is asserted that someone is mentally ill?

In what follows I shall describe briefly the main uses to which the concept of mental illness has been put.  I shall argue that this notion has outlived whatever usefulness it might have had and that it now functions merely as a convenient myth.},
