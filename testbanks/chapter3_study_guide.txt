MAIN IDEAS TO FOCUS ON:

 Clinical assessment is an ongoing process used to gather information through methods like interviews, tests, and observation.

 Key concepts in assessment include reliability, validity, and standardization.

 Multiple assessment methods are used including observation, interviews, psychological and neurological tests, and behavioral assessment.

 The DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 are major classification systems used for clinical diagnosis.

 A diagnosis involves identifying patterns of symptoms using structured criteria to aid treatment planning.

 Treatment includes multiple psychotherapeutic approaches as well as biological treatments.

 The effectiveness of psychotherapy is well-supported and depends on client, therapist, and method.

 Seeking treatment is not limited to severe mental illness; anyone may benefit from therapy at some point.
