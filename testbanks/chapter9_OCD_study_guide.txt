MAIN IDEAS TO FOCUS ON:

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) involves recurrent obsessions and compulsions that cause distress and impairment
Obsessions are intrusive, unwanted thoughts, images, or urges
Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to reduce anxiety or prevent feared outcomes
OCD is now classified separately from anxiety disorders but shares features like heightened anxiety responses
Body dysmorphic disorder involves preoccupation with perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance
Hoarding disorder is characterized by persistent difficulty discarding possessions
Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking disorder) involve repetitive body-focused behaviors
Cognitive-behavioral models emphasize dysfunctional beliefs and maladaptive coping in OCD and related disorders
Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the gold-standard behavioral treatment for OCD
Biological, cognitive, and behavioral factors all contribute to the development of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
